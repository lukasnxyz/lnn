## lnn
A minimal deep learning library inspired by tinygrad or micrograd. The goal of this library is to
make the building and modeling of neural networks extremely easy and minimal. (After getting some
base functionalities, I do plan on trying to make this an extremely efficient library as well with
accelerators and so forth.) For now, this is simply just a toy project for me to learn with.

Inspired by [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/) & [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

### Quick start
Setup virtual enviornment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv_lnn
source venv_lnn/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
